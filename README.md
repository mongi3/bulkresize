# bulkresize
python based utility for bulk resizing images for efficient use on web pages.

## Purpose
Working on some web based projects I found that 3rd parties would often
provide images with crazy large sizes and nested in subfolders and would
generally not be formatted well for web use.  The utility was created
to simplify the bulk resizing of these image subfolders for use by web.

## Usage

> usage: ./bulk_resize.py inDir outDir [max_width max_height]
